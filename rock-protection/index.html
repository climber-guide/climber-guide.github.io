    <p><b>Expansion Range vs. Operational Range</b></p>
    <p>
      You're on the upper section of a pitch, you have a <b>BD C4 .75</b> and a <b>BD C4 #2</b> left for hand sizes. Finding a stance, you try placing the <b>#2</b> but it won't squeeze in. Switching to the <b>.75</b>, it sticks but it's stressfully tipped out. As you tinker with the placement, you begin to regret "wasting" your <b>#1</b>s below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oddly, this example does not align with what we often on a cam's product page. Looking at range tables, a crack too small for a <b>#2</b> should be well within the range of a <b>.75</b>, noted by the red line on <i>Figure 1</i>. This disparity is due to range tables showing the <b>expansion range</b> of cams.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nearly all manufacturers, minus <i>Wild Country</i>, will show the <b>expansion range</b> of the cam. This is the absolute range of the device, from fully-cammed to no camming, as opposed to the usable range of a cam known as the <b>operational range</b>. To prevent the climber from overcamming and welding the device into the rock, manufacturers trim <b>10%</b>. On the other end for many reason (walking, lobe angle engagement, single axle failure, etc.), they take roughly <b>25%</b> off to protect from undercamming. This leaves each cam you own with a cozy 65% safe working range.*
    </p>
    <p>
      If we take the the previous chart and adjust it to show the <b>operational range</b> instead, the story above begins to line up in <i>Figure 2</i>.

      <i>* The following cases need to be made for nuanced use of a cam:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      An extremely overcammed device will not effect the strength rating, but may affect the friction coefficient. The friction might rely more on the natural constriction of the rock. You also risk turning your device into an expensive fixed nut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Single-axle cams can/will fail on the extreme end of undercamming. They do not have a passive strength rating. Double-axle cams however, if placed correctly, can be loaded from underneath the lobes.
